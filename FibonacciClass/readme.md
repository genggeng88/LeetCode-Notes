<h3>All Fibonacci similar problems can be solved using Dynamic Programming</h4>
<p><b>Basic idea:<br></b>
1. Find the backtracking solution for the last element.<br>
2. Backtrack to the first several elements which make up the base cases.<br>
3. Use an array to store all encountered situations.<br>
4. Return final result by using previous stores values.<br>


<b>Recursion/Backtracking</b><br>
Recursion or backtracking can also be used in Fibonacci similar problems. However, it takes O(n^2) time complexity while Dynamic Programming takes O(n).
