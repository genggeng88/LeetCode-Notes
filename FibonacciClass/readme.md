<h4>All Fibonacci similar problems can be solved using Dynamic Programming</h4>
<b>Basic idea:<br><b>
1. Find the backtracking solution for the last element.
2. Backtrack to the first several elements which make up the base cases.
3. Use an array to store all encountered situations.
4. Return final result by using previous stores values.


<b>Recursion/Backtracking</b><br>
Recursion or backtracking can also be used in Fibonacci similar problems. However, it takes O(n^2) time complexity while Dynamic Programming takes O(n).
